# hangman

This project will be a game of Hangman where the dictionary file is loaded and one out of 
ten thousand words are randomly selected(limited between 5 and 12 characters) so the player guesses a character based on a limited
number of turns which is 10. If the user guesses incorrectly, a guess is incremented by one. The 
player loses the game if all 10 guesses for character where the word is not displayed. If a player
has selected a chosen letter, then the letter will be outputted on the respective position on the screen to complete the word.
Additionally, incorrect characters selected to the user is to be shown. The letter selected should be made case-insensitive, capital
or lowercase. Beyond the use of character, functionality is going to be included in the game such that the player is allowed to save the game
in the middle of playing where no progress is lost when exiting.
